# User App with React

-This project is my first react project.
<br>
-There is a table where the user information is kept. 
<br>
-We have a form with 2 inputs.
<br>
-When we enter the username and email in this form and click the add button, the user is added to the table.
<br>
-User id is given randomly.
<br>
-When we want to delete the user, we can delete it by pressing the delete button in the table.
